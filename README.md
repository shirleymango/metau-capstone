## Overview
### Description

The brain is like any other muscle that needs to be trained. Forget Quizlet and welcome a new study tool that you can use to memorize nearly anything! This flashcards app uses *spaced repetition*. Spaced repetition is a technique where the user recalls a fact repeatedly over time. Actively recalling a memory decreases the rate of decay and we want to boost our curve of memory again and again until the fact is ingrained in our memory.


More info on spaced repetition:

This app will allow users to create flashcards and study them every day with the Leitner Box Schedule. There will be 7 levels for the cards. Level 1 cards are reviewed every day, Level 2 cards are reviewed every other day, Level 3 cards are reviewed every 4th day, all to way to Level 7 cards, which are reviewed every 64 days.
